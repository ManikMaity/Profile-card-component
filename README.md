## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- :hover, :root
- Desktop First 
- Padding, margin, border radius

### What I learned
  1. I have learned lot about position and background-image but I could not make the bg pattern show. Even I watched videos of this challege but that did not work also i think its because of my laptop or my browser

## Update
Finally fixed the project by added background patterns. [razalalkhan](https://github.com/razalalkhan) helped me in this.
